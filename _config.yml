  Hello! 👋 I am Stefano, a PhD researcher in Economics at NMBU, specializing in
  🌍 Carbon storage market analysis,
  ⚡ Direct Air Capture (DAC) and electricity market dynamics,
  📊 Econometrics of emissions and emission forecasting.
  I have a background in Economics and Finance from Università del Salento, where I completed my Master’s thesis in advanced econometrics. I am based in Oslo, but I am currently staying in Berlin as a visiting PhD researcher at DIW.
  When I am not in the office, I love playing music and discovering new genres and artists. I am also intrigued by the intersections between modern economic reasoning and philosophical and ethical considerations.
